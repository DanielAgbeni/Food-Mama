					Our Story
				</h2>
				<p className='mx-80px  px-24 text-center text-xl font-normal md:mx-1'>
					Food Mama is the brainchild of Chef Maria Rodriguez, whose passion for
					cooking was nurtured in her grandmother's kitchen. Inspired by the
					delicious, comforting meals her "Mama" used to prepare, Chef Maria
					embarked on a culinary journey to bring those cherished flavors to a
					wider audience.
				</p>

					Our restaurant is a tribute to those cherished family recipes, where
					each dish tells a story of tradition, innovation, and an unwavering
					commitment to quality. At Food Mama, we believe that food is more than
					sustenance; it's a source of joy and connection that brings people
					together.
